        <p class="lead mb-4">Jason Lee is a 20-year-old gym assistant who enjoys drone photography, listening to music and camping. He is kind and friendly, but can also be very cowardly and a bit sadistic.

He is a Japanese Buddhist. He started studying sports science at college but never finished the course. He is obsessed with cats.

Physically, Jason is in pretty good shape. He is average-height with walnut skin, grey hair and brown eyes. He has one or two distinguishing features including buck teeth and a tattoo of a cat between his shoulder blades.

He grew up in a middle class neighbourhood. He was raised by his mother, his father having left when he was young.

He is currently single. His most recent romance was with a lab assistant called Billy Joel Chandler, who was 10 years older than him. They broke up because Billy wanted somebody less mean.

Jason's best friend is a gym assistant called Kristen Morgan. They are inseparable. He also hangs around with Terry Nicholls and Willis Stanley. They enjoy watching YouTube videos together.<br><br>
